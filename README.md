This repository contains my response to a one day coding challenge set by Evgeny Shadchnev at Makers Academy in 2013.

The Tic Tac Toe Coding Challenge
Today we're playing Tic Tac Toe. Your task is to write a class (or set of classes, as you see fit) that would pass the given test suite (for the test suite, see the separate file: given_test_suite.md).

Feel free to modify the given test suite: add additional tests, change method signatures, etc, as long as it stays an adequate test suite for your code and covers all test cases mentioned there.

Every public method that you have must have test coverage.
